Project Name:
Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm

Problem:
In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its edges is minimized. This project focuses on solving the problem of finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Problem Statement:
Given a graph with nodes and weighted edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a destination node. This algorithm will efficiently compute the shortest paths in a graph by systematically visiting the nearest nodes and updating their distances.

Output:
The output of this project is the shortest path from the source node to the destination node in a graph. It will also include the total weight (cost) of the shortest path. Additionally, the program will display the path taken by the algorithm and the distance to each node from the source.

Methodologies
1. Graph Representation:
The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list where each node is connected to other nodes with weighted edges. The weights represent the cost or distance between nodes.

2. Dijkstra's Algorithm:
The core methodology used in this project is Dijkstra's Algorithm, which works as follows:

Initialization: Start by marking the source node with a distance of 0, and all other nodes with infinity.
Relaxation: For the current node, update the distances to its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.
Selection: After updating the neighbors, select the node with the smallest tentative distance as the next node to visit.
Repeat: Continue the process until all nodes have been visited, or the destination node is reached.
3. Algorithm Implementation:
Use a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently get the next node with the smallest tentative distance.
Keep track of the shortest paths to each node and update them as the algorithm progresses.
Once the destination node is reached, the algorithm terminates and the shortest path is displayed.

Conclusion:
The Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm provides an efficient solution for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. By utilizing a greedy approach with a priority queue, the algorithm ensures that the optimal path is found in a reasonable amount of time. This project demonstrates how Dijkstra's Algorithm can be implemented and applied to real-world problems such as routing and network optimization.
